# Project_6_static_node_and_express_site-v1
 Project 6 for the Treehouse Tech Degreee


My additions to the project:
- Removed "Learn More" link from the About page (since the link has no purpose when on the /about page).
- Added video elements to a couple of the projects to provide a better preview of the application.
- Change color theme. Changes include: 
  - Background color for all pages
  - Left menu and top bar (mobile) colors
  - Link background color and link hover state color
  - Boarder color for my thumbnail
- Transition effect on project thumbnails on index page
- Updated the responsive breakpoints and style to look better under 500px width.
